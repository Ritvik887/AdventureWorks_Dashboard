The dataset consisted of raw CSV files provided by Maven Analytics. The steps involved in the production of this Business Intelligence Report were as follows:
1. **Data Extraction** - Extracted the data from raw CSV files into the Power Query Editor.
2. **Data Hygiene and Transformation** - Corrected data types, promoted headers, and cleaned null values and duplicates.
3. **Data Transformation** - Added new columns for future measures, such as the start of the week and start of the year.
4. **Data Modelling** - After ETL, a data model with both a star and snowflake schema was designed, including one-to-many relationships.
5. **Data Processing** - Created explicit measures using DAX and added calculated columns where necessary.
6. **Data Visualization and Report Building** - Developed a fully interactive dashboard with dedicated product, geo-spatial, and customer information pages. Various visuals, such as gauges, KPI cards, and matrices, were included.
